# People-Churn-Modelling
It is churn modelling and prediction for employees of a bank with a size of around 10000. Depending on various factors like salary, credit cards, work hours we are going to predict weather the employee will stay in the company or not. 
It has data points of 10000 and I have tried to predict using the classification algorithms weather the employee will stay or exit the company.
Observing different features and outliers helped in understanding decision tree, random forest, xgboost algorithm.
Upon understanding the result from XGBoost, Random Forest, decision tree, I came up with exploration that age group between 40 to 60 play major role in as they are huge in number and poeple above 60 do not exit the company and people below 40(salary play important role).
Technologies used: Python, Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn.
