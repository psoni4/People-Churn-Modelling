# People-Churn-Modelling
It is churn modelling and prediction for employees of a bank with a size of around 10000. Depending on various factors like salary, credit cards, work hours we are going to predict weather the employee will stay in the company or not. 
It has data points of 10000 and I have tried to predict using the classification algorithms weather the employee will stay or exit the company.
